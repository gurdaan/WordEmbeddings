The backbone `jina-bert-v2-base-en` is pretrained on the C4 dataset¹. The model is further trained on Jina AI's collection of more than 400 millions of sentence pairs and hard negatives¹. These pairs were obtained from various domains and were carefully selected through a thorough cleaning process¹. The model was chosen for its ability to handle long sequences, making it particularly useful for tasks that require processing long documents, including long document retrieval, semantic textual similarity, text reranking, recommendation, RAG and LLM-based generative search, etc¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Model Value for Business Domain**: The `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en` model is of particular value to many business domains due to its extended context capabilities⁴. For instance, in the legal domain, it can capture and analyze intricate details in extensive legal texts effectively⁴. In the medical research domain, it can holistically embed scientific papers for advanced analytics and discoveries⁴. The model's ability to handle long sequences makes it especially useful when processing long documents is needed¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Licensing and Pricing Considerations**: The `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en` model is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license³. This means it can be used without any cost, making it a cost-effective choice for businesses. However, if you plan to use the model in a commercial product, you should review the terms of the Apache 2.0 license to ensure compliance. As for API usage, pricing would depend on the specific API provider and usage requirements. It's important to consider factors such as the number of API calls needed, data transfer costs, and whether the API provider offers a free tier or volume discounts. Always review the API provider's pricing documentation for the most accurate information.\n",

    "Model Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Layer**: The first layer is an Embedding layer, which is used for word embeddings. Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. The Embedding layer takes the integer-encoded vocabulary (`total_words`) and the length of input sequences (`max_sequence_len-1`) as inputs and produces dense vectors of fixed size (10 in this case). This layer can only be used as the first layer in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LSTM Layer**: The next layer is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer with 50 units. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn and remember over long sequences and is not prone to the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common issue with traditional RNNs. This makes LSTMs useful for processing and making predictions based on time series data or any data where the temporal dynamics are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dense Layer**: The final layer is a Dense layer, which is a regular densely-connected neural network layer. It implements the operation: `output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias)`. Here, `total_words` is the dimensionality of the output space and `softmax` is the activation function. The softmax function outputs a vector that represents the probability distribution of a list of potential outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compilation**: Finally, the model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems. The model's performance is measured with the `accuracy` metric during training and testing."

       "['The experiment that I outline in the following paper is designed to shed light on any relationship between information exposure and attentional cognition.',\n",
       " '\\tThe past few decades have been so information-filled and information-dependent that they have been appropriately deemed the “Information Age.” This trend can be attributed to increases in the accessibility, interconnectedness, and potency of technology, specifically big data. There are now more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day (Lu et al., 2014), enough to fill twenty billion human brains (Marois et al., 2005). Since we cannot physically intake all this information, we must navigate the sea of data to identify what is pertinent to us. The problem of prioritizing and processing select information is nothing new; it is likely that our brains evolved attentional mechanisms that internalize only the most important bits of information necessary to form a complete conception. But now, I hypothesize that our attentional mechanisms are having to work overtime because of the influx of information, and this is causing our attention to become less attune.',\n",
       " '\\tEmpirically testing my hypothesis will contribute to discovering the true nature of attention. Theories of attention are variable, and there is no one widely accepted account. Many theorists agree that attention can be broken down into passive and active states. Exogenous attention is used when our attention is unconsciously grabbed by something, while endogenous attention is at work when we consciously shift our attention to something. There is also speculation as to whether attention has a limited capacity and/or is a modular process. If attention does have a limited capacity, then either low-level or high-level perceptual processing -- or both -- are bottlenecked in such a way. If attention is a modular process, in the Fodor-ian sense of the term, then it must only operate on a certain kind of input (domain specific), run automatically in the presence of that input (mandatory processing), and be impervious to background knowledge or motivation (informationally encapsulated). ',\n",
       " '\\tPast studies considering the impact of information exposure on attention have focused on attention-span, which is the length of time an observer can attend to an object. While some studies affirm an effect, others discredit these claims and deny any impact of information exposure on attention-span at all. I, however, will be looking at the impact of information exposure (dependent variable) on change blindness (independent variable), a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a visual stimulus changes and the observer does not notice. Vision is one of the attentional mechanism’s tools for gathering information, and for this reason change blindness is an appropriate dependent variable. To accentuate change blindness, the observer’s attentional mechanism can be exploited by flashing back screens between image or animation changes; this disrupts any exogenous cues that may draw attention and instead forces the observer to use only their endogenous attention, which picks up on changes much slower. ',\n",
       " '\\tThe independent variable, information exposure, can be quantified using market integration: a measure of how easily two or more markets can trade with each other. The greater a group’s market integration, the more advanced their society is, the more technology their constituents possess, and the more information their constituents are exposed to. The measures of market integration I will be using are the percentage of a group’s calorical diet purchased in the market. These values vary from the 0 percent market-integration of the Hadza, a modern hunter-gatherer people living in northern Tanzania, to the 100 percent market integration of the urban center Accra, Ghana. In other words, the Hadza encounter little, if any, additional information besides themselves and their natural surroundings while Accranians are faced with significantly more information on a day-to-day basis (Ensminger et al., 2014).',\n",
       " '\\tThe experiment that I propose will draw a random sample of 30 people, 15 men and 15 women, from the Hadza (0 percent market integration), Maragoli (Western Kenyan community with 46 percent market integration), and Accra (100 percent market integration). In the first trial, all 90 participants will be individually exposed to a series of 30 pairs of random scenes on a computer ranging from industrial images to portrait photographs, each with focal objects (foreground) and contextual objects (background). The image presentation will alternate between 500 milliseconds of the original image, 80 milliseconds of a blank screen, 500 milliseconds of the original image with a slight change, and 80 more milliseconds of blank screen. This will continue until a minute elapses or the participant presses a key, indicating that they noticed the change, which they will have to orally identify after their trial is over to check for accuracy. Any misidentified changes will be subtracted from that participant’s score. The second trial will follow in the same manner as the first, except instead of still images, the presentations will be animated to control for any confounding stimuli (Masuda et al., 2006). Once the two trials are over, scores will be tallied for the Hadza, Maragoli, and Accra participants, and compared against their market integration values.',\n",
       " '\\tIf my hypothesis is not supported by the data, and greater market integration does not correlate with lower scores on change blindness tests but instead with higher scores, then doubts would be raised toward current attentional theories. This finding would maintain that information-intake does not distress our attentional filters, begging the question: are our attentional mechanisms bottlenecked at all? Further research would need to be done on limited capacity theories to reach an empirically-backed answer. Other interesting research to pursue given a falsified hypothesis may include replicating the experiment without random images and instead with images from a social media platform. A Hadza participant from rural Tanzania whose society has 0 percent market integration and little-to-no technology would be much less accustomed to Instagram screenshots or Tiktok videos than an Accranian participant whose urban center has 100 percent market integration and technology at the fingertips. If it can be shown that the Accranian participants perform better than the Hadzans on change blindness testing with social media imagery because of their society’s greater market integration, this may count against the modular nature of the attentional mechanism. Specifically, this would jeopardize the attentional mechanism’s informationally encapsulated nature because it is drawing on information about technological interfaces from elsewhere in the mind.',\n",
       " '\\tIf my hypothesis is supported by the data, and greater market integration correlates with lower scores on change blindness tests, then limited capacity theories of attention would be upheld. Replication would still be needed, but confidence in the hypothesis that information exposure distresses filters of attention would increase, as would confidence in attention’s bottleneck-like architecture. Ethical concerns about big data and mass information would be raised too. If information exposure is wearing down the precision of our attentional mechanisms, then what other cognitive havoc is it wreaking? As an information-dependent society, we may need to look into proactive measures to artificially filter and sort information before it gets presented to the consumer. We would also need to pursue research that dives deeper into which populations are most vulnerable to attentional decay.',\n",
       " '\\tI would like to see this experiment carried out because of its cognitive and societal implications. It may revitalize our conception of attention. Or, it may warrant big data and information reform. Both are equally important.',\n",

       " 'America’s two-party system is plagued by antipathy and inaction. As Americans filter into one party or the other, political attitudes and ideals are becoming as binary as the two-party system itself. At the polls, voters habitually adopt the policy stances of their preferred party. On the Senate floor, representatives vehemently refuse to reach across the aisle. At the end of the day, Americans turn on cable news, returning to the comfort of their political echo chambers. Perhaps this is why John Adams warned in 1780 that “a Division of the Republick into two great Parties … is to be dreaded as the greatest political Evil under our Constitution.”',\n",
       " '\\tAlthough the American Constitution lends itself to a two-party makeup, the rise of a third, fourth, or fifth party is not impossible. And, from a psychological standpoint, the diversification of competing ideologies ought to be welcomed with open arms. Currently, America’s two-party system is incompatible with the psychological dispositions of American voters because it demotivates bipartisan information-seeking and imparts polarizing unconscious attitudes. Instead, psychological dispositions warrant a party system that observes attitudinal differences but does not promote staunch polarization. Enter: the multi-party system.',\n",
       " '\\tIn the following analysis, I discuss the psychological implications of two political factors – partisanship and media – on American voters in two-party and multi-party systems. First, I argue that a multi-party system is more conducive to effective partisanship because it motivates information-seeking behavior that fits party identifications to people’s actual beliefs. Then, I argue that a multi-party system creates a more amicable media environment and tempers hostile unconscious attitudes. Finally, I end with a discussion of whether a multi-party system in America is truly realizable.',\n",

       " '\\tAmericans are inclined to side with a party because it allows them to be political actors without needing political literacy. Forming political attitudes is as easy as figuring out what the stance of one’s preferred party is. Electing a preferred party is as easy as mapping one or two matters of personal importance to the party’s policy ideals. In doing so, voters minimize the cognitive resources spent on making political judgments and maintain confidence that those judgments reflect their values and affirm their prior beliefs (Lavine et al., 2012). ',\n",
       " 'But endorsing an entire belief system based on an issue-specific consideration leaves quite a large margin of error in assuming the rest of the party’s political judgments. Who’s to say that just because the Democrats and I both support gun control, I will also support increasing income tax? Still, voters forego important information in favor of adopting party cues and making such assumptions. In a study of tax policy opinions in the 2012 California general election, participants in the aggregate ignored inequality information and instead chose to position themselves along party lines (Boudreau et al., 2014). The consequences here cannot be understated. Using party cues as substitutes for information risks making irrational political judgments that don’t align with one’s actual beliefs. It also leads to a less informed and less knowledgeable electorate. Most importantly, it mitigates compromise. Rather than considering issues objectively or on a case-by-case basis, people endorse the opinions of their preferred party and, without consuming any perspective-shifting information, do not cross party lines. ',\n",
       " 'So, the ideal party system will look to correlate partisan beliefs with people’s actual beliefs and motivate thoughtful information processing as much as possible. How do the two-party and multi-party systems match up?',\n",
       " 'In a two-party system, it’s easy for people to form partisan identities on the basis of few issue-specific considerations. Because there are only two parties, and the parties’ ideologies are relatively polar, discerning where the parties stand on a given issue is clear-cut. If my determinant issue consideration is restrictive immigration, it’s easy to see that Republicans support closed-door policy, Democrats support open-borders, and that I should identify with the Republicans. Forming a partisan identity based on personally important matters is straightforward and there’s no need to further research policy stands. Information-seeking behavior is motivated by uncertainty – a confidence gap between one’s experienced level of confidence and their desired level of confidence (Lavine et al., 2012). But there is little to no uncertainty in determining partisanship in a two-party system; if I care most about restrictive immigration, I simply endorse the Republicans. In the absence of uncertainty, not only are people be unmotivated to learn more, but they process any political information they do come across peripherally, picking up on party cues and choosing to accept or reject the information along party lines. Without engaging with the issue under consideration, people assume that their party’s stance is congruent with their own (Petty et al., 1996). Yet, it is equally – if not more – likely that the majority of the party’s policy stances and political values do not reflect what one would choose to uphold had they considered political information thoughtfully.',\n",
       " 'Multi-party systems, on the other hand, demand more issue-specific considerations than two-party systems do. With more parties, the political spectrum grows wider and more convoluted. No longer is one party the opposite of another; instead, parties may overlap, supporting similar ideals but different policies or vice versa. In a multi-party system with coinciding ideologies, uncertainty emerges in deciding where to pledge partisan allegiance. Electing a partisan identity requires some distinguishable X factor that will set one party more in line with one’s beliefs than the rest. Uncertainty, then, motivates further research into parties’ stances on other personally important matters or consideration of ideals beyond just those that are issue-specific. Uncertainty also motivates systematic processing of that information, resulting in genuine political knowledge and conscientious attitude formation (Lavine et al., 2012). This catalyzes a positive feedback loop: the more politically aware individuals become, the more likely they are to continue relying on issue-relevant values rather than party cues when forming political judgments (Kam, 2005). Unlike the demotivational responses evoked by a two-party system, a multi-party system motivates systematic consideration of information during the partisan identification process. In turn, a multi-party system produces more knowledgeable political actors and tailors party identifications more closely to people’s actual beliefs.',\n",

For the average American, the quickest and easiest point of entry into the political world is media – cable news, political journals, digital social networks, etc. (Delli Carpini et al., 1996). But most of these media outlets are not in the business of broadcasting objective facts; in America, objective facts don’t sell. Rather, most media outlets garner viewership using polarizing political narratives that appeal to one side of the aisle. Such narratives are riddled with hostile rhetoric that paints the opposing party as the enemy (every good story has a villain).',\n",
       " '\\tNaturally, the information that we consume constitutes what we know. Yet, the information that viewers deduce from media is relatively homogenous. As Taber and Lodge (2006) illustrate in a series of experiments exploring how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, when people are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read, they choose confirming arguments over disconfirming arguments (Taber et al., 2006). Americans are poised to avoid contradictory information and return to the same narratives time and time again. Eventually, this can form unconscious attitudes. The more exposed an individual is to a particular political message, the stronger an evaluation they form, the more accessible in memory it becomes, and the stronger influence it will have on cognitive processes and behaviors (Arcuri, 2008). When political messaging is polarizing and hostile, consequent unconscious attitudes inhibit any possibility of attitude change or compromise.',\n",

       " '\\tA two-party system breeds hostility because there is a salient tension between ingroup and outgroup. The enemy in a two-party system – the lone outgroup – is easy to identify and vulnerable to hostile narratives. As of late, particularly in the Trump-era election cycles, political attitudes in America across the aisle and in the headlines have become almost primal in nature. Anthems as pervasive as “Lock her up!” and “Stop the count!” have the power to instill unconscious attitudes that further entrench party lines. A 2015 study comparing implicit partisan affect with other social divides in America found that hostile, unconscious feelings toward opposing parties cause political polarization that is even stronger than polarization elicited by race (Iyengar et al., 2015). America is far from healing its racial divide, and perhaps even further from reducing political polarization. As long as outgroup hostility prevails in media, the two-party chasm will continue to grow.',\n",
       " '\\tIn contrast, multi-party systems foster a more amicable media environment because there is not as much opportunity for narrative-stitching. Different parties clash on some policy stands and agree on others, thus there is no consistent, clear enemy (no one likes a reality TV show with new characters each episode). Unconscious attitudes require message repetition and emotional provocation, but with an erratic and less hostile narrative, unconscious attitudes are less likely to form. Dissociating political tensions across a number of parties helps alleviate the targeted messaging and polarizing attitudes we saw in two-party systems. It’s easy to villainize outgroups when there’s only one, but much harder to spin a compelling story when villains are diverse and some of them occasionally act like the good guys.',\n",

But structural parallels between linguistic and music theory and recent findings in neuroimaging show that the way we learn, understand, and produce music and language are not all that different. Capitalizing on their likeness may have far-reaching implications for text-generating AI systems. ',\n",
       " \"        \\tAs they relate to the human mind, language and music both (1) rely on syntactic structure and (2) involve the same brain regions for processing. Musical and linguistic syntax are hierarchical structures that organize inputs into predictable, meaningful patterns. In language, speech sounds are combined to form words, words are arranged to form sentences, meaning is derived from sentences, and contexts are interpreted from meaning. It is the linguistic syntax -- the set of rules that arranges words and phrases -- that connects a language's structure with its meaning (Jackendoff, 2009). Similarly, in music, multiple levels of organization give rise to meaningful sequences. Tones are combined to form scales, specific notes of scales are harmonized to create chords, chords that share scalar properties comprise a key, a key’s tones and chords are organized into song-form, and from song-form the listener derives a sensuous experience. The musical syntax -- song-form, the ordering of tones and chords -- links music’s structure with its meaning in the same way that linguistic syntax does (Patel, 2010).\",\n",
       " \"        \\tMapping language and music processing in the human brain has revealed surprising overlap and breadth. Research during the 1960s found that patients with damage to certain areas of the left hemisphere developed aphasia, while those with damage to certain areas of the right hemisphere suffered from amusia (Kleist, 1962). These results led to the conclusion that the left hemisphere was strictly responsible for language and the right for music. Specifically, it was thought that language was restricted to Broca's area, which governs the meaning of words, and Wernike’s area, which dictates syntactic structure. But with the advent of fMRI, scientists discovered that Broca’s and Wernike’s areas were also activated when processing music both aurally and visually (Steinbeis et al., 2008). Further fMRI studies have shown that regions of the right hemisphere operate during language and music processing as well. It has since been suggested that the left and right hemispheres have broad functions that language and music both recruit. The left hemisphere specializes in hierarchical sequencing like syntax and meaning while the right processes contour-based patterns and emotional affect. Put simply, the left hemisphere identifies denotation and the right interprets connotation (Harvard-Smithsonian, 2010).\",\n",
       " '        \\tThe similarities between language and music reveal symbolic and physical structures that the human brain uses to create and communicate: rigid syntax organizes structural components, the left hemisphere processes its literal meaning, and the right hemisphere extrapolates this meaning. ',\n",
       " 'Understanding and modeling these building blocks has allowed music-producing AIs to get off the ground. IBM Watson Beat, a neural network that composes original music, is a foremost example. The system learns by consuming audio files broken down into their core syntactic elements, which are linked with information on emotions and musical genres. These structural reference points allow IBM Watson Beat to interpret and classify music; they also resemble the building blocks of language and music used in the human brain. The project started in 2016, and by 2018 IBM Watson Beat was reliably producing coherent, original music (IBM, 2018). Today, some music artists like Taryn Southern use music-producing AI as inspiration (Deahl, 2018) while others are using it to create entire songs or albums, such as the first AI-produced album “Hello World” (Hello, n.d.). There is still room to grow and perfect music-producing AI, but recent progress is reflective of an accurate understanding of how the human brain processes music.',\n",
       " 'IBM Watson Beat’s demonstrated comprehension of music theory is remarkable, but its ability to form connections between musical elements and emotions are what allowed it to pioneer artificial music production. Previous attempts to create a music-producing AI overlooked the right hemisphere’s role in music contextualization and as a result could not create cohesive pieces. The connection between musical data points and emotion is so integral because the human brain does not create music out of thin air. Rather, the musician draws on sensuous experience as the muse for a piece. When music is created, human experience is translated to musical syntax using emotion. For instance, “broken up with” is represented by minor keys and “sexual pleasure” is represented by major keys. Conversely, when music is listened to, musical syntax is translated to an affective human experience by interpreting emotion in the right hemisphere of the brain. The right hemisphere uses emotion as the mediator between human experience and musical syntax, which gives a musical piece coherence (Madell, 2002).',\n",
       " '        \\tText-generating AIs, on the other hand, have not seen as much success. GPT-2, produced by OpenAI, is the most advanced text-generating AI to date. Given a prompt, the neural network’s objective is to predict the most likely next word. GPT-2 produces impressive text, often many paragraphs long, that can convince the naive reader. This step forward in narrative capacity has put GPT-2 ahead of other text-generating AI like Word2vec and Google Translate, which struggle to create any narrative at all. But there is still an element of creativity and coherence missing. GPT-2 needs a thorough prompt to generate text from, and even with that crutch, its logicality eventually falls off the rails (Radford, 2019). GPT-2 moves as quickly as possible between words to decide which is most likely to follow in sequence, but strict mathematical probability omits any consideration of the meaning that mediates language (Hofstadter, 2020).',\n",
       " '        \\tI propose that the shortcoming of GPT-2 and other text-generating AIs may be that they overlook the right hemisphere’s role in understanding and creating language. Since the right hemisphere is responsible for extrapolating connotations, a lack of coherence among outputs of text-generating AIs could be attributed to a lack of context that the right hemisphere usually provides. Like music, words and sentences are not spontaneously created. They are guided by emotions, experience, and context, which the right hemisphere uses in translation with linguistic syntax. When music-producing AIs adopted mechanisms to imitate the right hemisphere, the coherence of their outputs dramatically improved. While music is more mathematical than language, and thus music-producing AIs are easier to program than text-generating AIs, language’s lack of mathematical structure only means that understanding it requires relying even more so on the right hemisphere’s contextual processing. Given the similarities between language and music processing in the human brain, and the need for a meaning-mediator in text-generating AI, perhaps the same solution that worked for music-producing AI can be applied to text-generating AI. Further work will need to be done to identify the specific roles of the right hemisphere in language processing and how it mediates language.',\n",

From short stories to film noir to musical masquerades, the context surrounding an uncanny experience has been anything but consistent. As a result, I grew curious about what architectural features are most likely to activate the uncanny.

I then fed various combinations of keywords to Midjourney, a text-to-image generator, which returned artificial illustrations. Next, I compared the artificially generated images to imagery from the original texts and films I had analyzed. I looked for similarities and differences in the “uncanniness” of each image, trying to identify what the author, director, or Midjourney might have done to effectively activate an uncanny experience.

A text-to-image model is a machine learning model that takes a natural language description as input and produces an image matching that description. These models were initially quite naïve, but due to recent advances in data processing power, new models like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Imagen have approached the quality of real photographs and human-made art. They begin as a long series of digits between 0 and 1; these weights are subsequently trained using billions of samples of images and their associated alternate captions (the text you see describing an image when it fails to load on a webpage). Over time, the models adjust their internal digits to build associations between text inputs and image outputs. What makes these models so interesting is that they create an entirely unique image.2 This is encouraging for the present experiment because the image outputs we get from “uncanny” text inputs are the result of what an objective machine, trained billions of times over, believes “uncanniness” to look like.

Light does not necessarily have to be an intrinsic property of architecture; oftentimes, it is added on top of an existing structure to turn it from something familiar into something wildly unfamiliar. In this way, you can make architecture feel alien without changing anything about the architecture itself. This is what makes Figure 1b and Figure 1c feel uncanny to me. The Jolly Corner is riddled with mentions of varieties of light such as “autumn,” “crepuscular,” “uncertain,” and “electric.” As seen in Figure 1c, A building which was once a joyful, Victorian townhouse, familiar to both Spencer Brydon and the viewer, is rendered unfamiliar by the orange glow of nightfall. Midjourney picks up on the notion of a “white electric lustre” in Figure 1b by making a grand Victorian window the only illuminative source in the scene. Both The Jolly Corner and generative AI do a good job of making traditionally comforting architecture feel haunted with their use of unfamiliar light.',\n",
       " 'Conversely, The Jolly Corner and Midjourney also exploit an absence of light to create a sense of uncanniness. Darkness turns familiar architecture in foreign realms by inhibiting vision, the sense that we rely on most to navigate the world. Without the power of sight, we lose most of our ability to corroborate familiarity. Think about a trip into a dark basement – even if it is in your own house, you may still feel an urge to get in and get out as quickly as possible. Darkness causes the human mind to run rampant with theories and fears about what could be on the other side of the shadow, regardless of how unlikely it may be. This is what gives Figure 2b and Figure 2c an uncanny aura. In Figure 2c, Spencer Brydon has only a flickering candle (which itself is uncanny) to illuminate his familiar childhood home. But with a limited field of view, Brydon begins to duck and dodge at every dark corner. He grew up in this home, yet the darkness it casts at dusk forces him to wonder what sorts of specters may lurk in its shadows. Figure 1b follows a similar logic. The silhouetted shadow of a human is eerie in its own right, but the vignetted corners of the image compounds our fear response. Darkness can leave spine-chilling questions unanswered, such as where the person’s shadow is coming from and what else may be found in the dark.',\n",
       " 'Silhouettes are a particular kind of darkness with a proclivity for uncanniness, since they leave an especially disconcerting question unanswered: who is it? Most of the media we analyzed in this course featured some sort of human silhouette, and The Third Man may be the exemplar of them all. Figure 3c illustrates how silhouettes manifest in The Third Man. While police and Holly Martins are waiting for Harry Lime – a fugitive of homicidal proportions – a large silhouette appears on the wall of a war-torn square. They have some knowledge, that the shadow is that of a human, but their vision is still occluded enough to push their minds into unfamiliarity and fear (irrationally so, as the silhouette turns out to be a man with balloons). Figure 3b is an artificial image generated using phrases from The Third Man screenplay. Clearly, Midjourney has picked up on the uncanniness of a dark silhouette, filling in edges of the image with more dark architecture to accentuate the phenomenon of visual occlusion.',\n",

       " '\\tThe context that architecture is situated within has the power to influence whether it is interpreted as uncanny. The human mind builds understanding through associations, and if we come to associate architecture with an uncanny history or circumstance, we will likely consider the architecture uncanny on its own as well. Consider a haunted house: for 364 days of the year, a haunted house is simply just a house, but on Halloween (when you are told that hundreds of clowns died there last year) a familiar house can turn profoundly uncanny. ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'The Bridge on the Drina is another example of how context alters perception. As we discussed in class, the Bridge on the Drina is not an intrinsically uncanny bridge. If you were walking through Višegrad on a sunny day, you might even say that the bridge is especially beautiful or comforting. However, once we have read the tales that Ivo Andriс́ recounts – that a mother walled her children inside the bridge, that a rebel was publicly hung from its arches, that the surrounding townspeople were enslaved to ensure its construction – the bridge becomes wildly unfamiliar and eerie. Figure 4b captures the idea of “associative uncanniness.” When I had input descriptors about the bridge alone, such as “skillfully built stone bridge with a mysterious history,” Midjourney returned traditional, familiar bridges. However, once I included mentions of how the bridge “turned the town into a hell,” the color scheme turned dark and fiery as seen in Figure 4b. A similar association was made when I added “exploited workers” to the text input. The subsequently generated image is Figure 5b, featuring a bridge rendered uncanny when you learn that the depicted workers are enslaved. ',\n",
       " 'Both Figure 4b and Figure 5b look eerily similar to Figure 5c, which shows the Bridge on the Drina surrounded by a wartime haze after it was partially destroyed during World War I bombings. It is a testament to the power of context how artificially generated images, just by nature of their historical contexts, can look like a real-world image of familiar architecture turned into unrecognizable rubble.',\n",
